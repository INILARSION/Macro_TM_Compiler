# Makro Turing machine compiler

This macro compiler compiles Turing machine programs which contain macros to Turing machine programs for the standard or nondeterministic Turing machine.

Build with the Makefile by executing `make`.

Execute with `macro_compiler <program file>`.

Examples of Turing machine programs with macros are available in the examples folder.
